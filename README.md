# Love Maths

The love maths site was created as part of a walkthrough series of lessons for the JavaScript module in the Code Institutes Diploma in Full Stack Web Development.

It is a maths game that allows users to practice their core mathematics skills in addition, subtraction, division and multiplication.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

The colour scheme for the site was kept very simple, using four colours for the buttons and a grey background for the games container.

![Love Maths Colour Palette](documentation/lovemaths-colour.png)

### Typography

The Raleway font has been used for the site, with a back-up of sans-serif.

### Wireframes

Wireframes were created for mobile, tablet and desktop using basalmiq.

![Love Maths Wireframes](documentation/lovemathswireframe.png)

### Features

Love maths is comprised of one page which holds the game container.

![Love Maths Site](documentation/lovemaths-site.png)

### Accessibility

I have been mindful during coding to ensure that the website is as accessible friendly as possible. This has been have achieved by:

* Using semantic HTML.
* Ensuring that there is a sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.

### Future Implementations

* Improve the responsiveness of the site.
* Add a countdown timer to add an extra element of difficulty to the game.
* Add difficulty levels to the game, which would encourage players to progress to the next level while practicing their skills.
* Add instructions on how to play the game (possibly via a modal).

## Testing

Testing was ongoing throughout the entire build. I utilised Chrome developer tools while building to pinpoint and troubleshoot any issues as I went along.

### W3C Validator

The W3C validator was used to validate the HTML. It was also used to validate CSS in the style.css file. Both files passed validation with no errors.

* [index.html](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fkera-cudmore.github.io%2Flove-maths%2F)
* [style.css](documentation/love-maths-css.png)

### Jshint JavaScript Validator

JShint was used to validate the JavaScript.

* [script.js](documentation/jshint-validation.png)

### Testing User Stories

| I want to be able to switch the type of questions I answer. | Users can change the questions by selecting one of the math buttons | ![change questions](documentation/us-change-questions.png) |
| I want to be able to keep track of my score. | At the bottom of the game screen is a score counter which allows users to keep track of the scores, both correct and incorrect | ![scores evidence](documentation/us-scores.png)|

### Lighthouse
