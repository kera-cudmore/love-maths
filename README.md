## User Experience (UX)

### User Stories

* As a user, I want to be able to understand how to use the site without having to read instructions.
* As a user, I want to be able to switch the type of questions I answer.
* As a user, I want to be able to keep track of my score.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

The colour scheme for the site was kept very simple, using four colours for the buttons and a grey background for the games container.

### Typography

The raleway font has been used for the site, with a back-up of sans-serif.

### Wireframes

Wireframes were created for mobile, tablet and desktop using basalmiq.

### Features

Love maths is comprised of one page which holds the game container.

* Future Implementations.

In a future implementation I would like to add some instructions on how to play the game, possibly via a modal. I would also like to look into adding a countdown timer to add an extra element of difficulty to the game.

### Accessibility

I have been mindful during coding to ensure that the website is as accessible friendly as possible. This has been have achieved by:

* Using semantic HTML.
* Ensuring that there is a sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.

## Testing

Testing was ongoing throughout the entire build. I utilised Chrome developer tools while building to pinpoint and troubleshoot any issues as I went along.

### W3C Validator

The W3C validator was used to validate the HTML. It was also used to validate CSS in the style.css file. Both files passed validation with no errors.
